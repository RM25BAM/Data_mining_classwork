Interoperability of health information has been declared as a national objective to be achieved using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The HITECH Act of 2009 in the US helped facilitate the adoption of EHRs by authorizing incentive payments through Medicare and Medicaid to hospitals and clinicians for using EHRs to achieve improvements in health-care delivery. SNOMED CT, being a global standardized terminology and a requirement for the meaningful use of EHRs, will play an integral role in achieving widespread exchange of clinical information and decision support tools. However, quality issues with SNOMED CT may hinder the progress that we have seen with the adoption of EHRs at hospitals and clinics. Therefore, it becomes essential that efficient methods be formulated to assure the quality of SNOMED CT. This study presents a machine learning approach using a context-based, lexical method. The results show that such computational methods can effectively be used to identify problematic areas in SNOMED CT where the limited auditing resources could then be allocated.
